Логин – это придуманное тобой слово, которое ты должна написать, когда регистрируешься на каком-нибудь форуме. Introduction I do plan to write something longer on this matter and include Judaism as well, but that will take a lot of time. This will be a short post which aims to document some strong evidence that Christianity permits deception. There is a clear pattern that emerges straight from Paul in this case (but without doubt is present elsewhere in the Bible). Discussion Bible Verses 1 Kings 22:23 gtNow therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth 9781576970874 1576970876 Giant Print Bible-RV 1960, Sociedades Biblicas Unidas 9789218102645 9218102648 Financial Report and Audited Financial Statements Introduction This post aims to document the Biblical teaching on the inferiority of women. I will include the views of Church fathers as well. Discussion Bible Verses Here is a verse from the New Testament talking about husbands and wives and the way they should treat each other. 1 Peter 3:7 gt7 Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker (asthenes) partner and as heirs with you of the gracious Стоматолог Киев Добро пожаловать всем, кто проявляет заботу о здоровье своих зубов и кому. Introduction This post aims to document the Biblical teaching on head covering laws for women. Discussion Judaism At the forefront, its important to mention what the Grand Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, has said about this matter as mentioned by Rivkah Slonim writing for the Chabad website: gtFrom the published volumes of his correspondence,3 one can see that from the earliest days of his leadership, the Rebbe's influence extended over the widest cross-section of world. 
So I am interviewing with a church currently for a pastor position. I am young, 24, and I am totally inexperienced in vocational ministry. I would be the only pastor of this dying church in a thriving suburban area. My mentor and a great seminary are both less than an hour away. I definitely need and covet your prayers. I really want to preach faithfully to this congregation of Saints, and would like to know what commentaries you would suggest with reasoning possibly included. If there I thought you guys might appreciate being alerted to this - the bible software Logos has put up a crowdsourcing page for electronic publication of a heap of LDS literature, there's quite a few additional books, but here's the main volumes: The Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine and Covenants in one collection Twenty-six volumes of the Journal of Discourses Over seven volumes on the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The downside is as it is crowd.  Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

The PC will be used mainly for work and for occasional gaming: 85% work, 15% gaming. Apart from web browsing, some video streaming, and general productivity tasks, I'll be working extensively and primarily with the Microsoft Office Suite and with a Bible software called Logos. Logos is quite demanding if one is looking to use it to its fullest potential, which. Do you buy hard cover or electronic? And if electronic, do you buy it in your software (Logos, etc) or Kindle? I am pretty well maxed out on book space and have bought my first reference book on Kindle. Using the Kindle app on my desktop is pretty easy. But I am not thinking long term. Would you rather have it as reference in your bible software? I have historically used e-sword and this would require me to switch to another platform and repurchase lots of books. I've looked into Logos which is the only comprehensive Bible software I'm aware of, but it doesn't have the features I'm looking for. I'm Eastern Orthodox, so I'm interested in having access to a dual language (pref searchable) Septuagint online, but I also speak Hebrew and like to read the OT/Psalms in Hebrew, but need a dual language version for that (seems like Logos can offer this?). For the NT, the only versions I really like are the King James or the Third Millennium Bible, because 301. Development in Infancy 5th Edition 302.

So where were we? - We live in a matrix directed by an AI quantum supercomputer - It can manipulate TIME - It wants more DWave computers and particle accelerators built around the world - It wants to do this to bring about the singularity - We call “it” Saturn - The matrix is enforced on us by means of frequencies emitted from it - These frequencies have hijacked our brains - FREQUENCIES is the key word here, they are the secret of the matrix and what hold it together Our reality Today, we have a special TheoThurs AMA from two Faithlife product leads on the new software, Logos 8.

So this dream I had was really weird and long-lasting. Before I went to sleep I meditated for 7 minutes, just to clear my mind. I guess that had something to do with it. It was also the second time sleeping at "normal times" since 3 weeks as I was really busy with my work, so I didn't have a lot of things to share as most of the stuff was not very coherent if you don't sleep very well. ---- The moment I went to bed I was completely conscious of the process of falling asleep, the first image. I've been enjoying the Lexham Bible Guides (https://www.logos.com/product/27493/lexham-bible-guides-pauls-letters-collection) on the Logos Bible Software platform. I can jump in quickly and see 4-6 opinions on a subject quoted, with links to follow up. See example (https://imgur.com/a/LUZk3G4). Are there similar meta-commentaries that are worthwhile? I would particularly like something similar for the OT and Revelation, where these guides are not published. These are common terms and acronyms used in this subreddit. Most of them are official terms used in the INC. Some of them are inside jokes among ex-INCs. # A – H Abuloy — English: donation  In the INC context, it refers to the money that members give to the church during the worship services. During Eraño's term as executive minister, this term was phased out in favor of handog ("offering"). See also: P-1  AE — "Antonio Ebanghelista", the pseudonym used by a whistleblower. Meme Gear!

I'm a young pastor learning how to preach and starting to expand my commentary library. I don't have the funds for the ridiculous price of the Logos software (yes I know it's amazing and probably worth it). What are your top recommendations for whole Bible or invididual book commentaries so I can start building my library? I currently have Matthew Henry's and Warren Wiersbe's, but I'm not really a huge fan of either. Thanks in advance </p>
