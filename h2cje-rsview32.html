                            <p> I have a project with multiple tags being logged to a SQL database. I've done everything on one PC and build my Visual Basic prg. around the TAGS logged to the database, with pointers to TagIndex(0)=MachineNo., tagindex(1)=CycleTime and so forth. But when doing the setup on the clients PC in RSView32 it changes the TabIndex representation of the Tags I and logs the Tags under a new TagIndex. So that tagindex(7)=MachineNo. and TagIndex(0)=CycleTime. Is there a way to change the order A customer wants me to look into converting his older system to a more up to date system as he has run out of space for new recipes. I have worked with all of them but I dont have a ton of experience converting between them. Our good friends at AB make it seem like its pretty simple but is that true or is it a clever rouse. 
Does anybody have any advice on how Ignitions Taghistorical offering compares to how FT amp RSV32 typically log data? We are Looking at Ignition as a replacement for RSV32/FTV and it's looking like any requirement for large amounts of tags is not very well suited to ignition and reporting on data better suited to ignition itself rather than externally. Rockwell allow you to simply create different data logs with the required tags so you can group things and create your own tables. I have just completed a hardware upgrade and migrated our Rsview32 active display servers from physical servers (win server 2k3) to windows7 VM's in a VMware cluster. I chose windows 7 since it's still available in 32bit and still in support; the only option really and tests were ok. I know there's limitations in IIS on win 7 but I'm within connection limits i think!. Since the upgrade there's an intermittent 20 to 30 second delay from someone clicking and issuing a login command from a standar. So I have finally been told i've got the money to spend on upgrading away from RSView32 (waaaay!!) My clear prefrence after research and some test and development is Ignition. Someone in management has since suggested I look at Honeywell PHD since some other "people" use it and "it's always good to standardize these things" Anybony care to comment with any comarisons, pro's con's with the 2 solutions. Long Story Short: I've been dealing lately with a migration from RSView32 to FTView SE and I still cannot understand why they had to move the entire scripting functionality from the server to the client. The idea of using a script written in a background screen and triggering it by a change in an indicator is mind-boggling. Not to mention I have to put extra conditions on the migrated VBA functions because they randomly execute multiple times at a single call. I've worked on several platforms. 
Hi, Have a SCADA running on RSView32 from a program running on RSLogix500 on an SLC500 DH+ network. Every time we close the SCADA to make changes (adding a flow-rate for example) when the screen comes back up none of the output values appear on the screen - not just the new ones, all of them. Every time. The only way to get it back is to unplug and plug in the DH+ plug on the back of the PC until it comes back up. Sometimes 2 minutes, sometimes 20 minutes. Admittedly I haven’t much experi. Hey guys so I am still fairly new to Rockwell, I've been working with it for almost 2 years, but never learned about any Rockwell software other than RSLogix when I was in school, so it has been a learning process on the job. So, if my terminology is off, I apologize. So we are migrating from RSView32 to FTView SE and Historian Classic to Historian SE. We got 90% of the work done, with the help of a few days with a RA Integrator. We converted the RSView32 project to a FTView SE project I've been going nose to the grindstone the last six months on a couple projects. One using AB Micrologix and RSView32, and another working with some old school Motorola RTU's. What cool new things in the industry have I been missing 
I'd hope everyone doesn't just tells me that I shouldn't of applied to the job, I'm a first year and I'm just trying to get every opportunity I can get. I more or less applied to this job because I thought it was pretty cool and interesting. Hopefully someone can give me some tips on getting through an interview, where as a first year I just lack a lot of the described skills. Otherwise I would also like to know if I should expect the employer to be aware of my shortcomings since </p>
