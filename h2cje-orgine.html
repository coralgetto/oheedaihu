                            <p>Hello, Is there something I am doing wrong? I purchased 36k orgines and I didn't even get my Eliom. Has anyone been able to buy these from the shop? I'd like to get the 30day booster, but their payment system doesn't seem to accept my card or the paypal tells me I'm in the wrong region. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong here or what. I was gonna try that Ultimategamer card but they seem to have been discontinued. Hi :) so i wanted to play wakfu after i stopped playing dofus like 1 year ago my question is if wakfu haves an orgine market like dofus cus thats one of the reasons i stopped playing i dont like it when you can pay 60$ and get like 40mil from it so does wakfu haves I need to start by saying that i dont know anything about wine. But I am looking to buy a wine for someone. she loves cab franc, and doing some research last time, learned that Olga Raffault Chinon is a good buy for a cab franc lover. doing some reading on their estate, it seems like there are 3 expressions. >Les Picasses is aged the longest before release: a minimum of four years, mainly in old foudres, some of chestnut as well oak. This wine lives for decades, and the family has always. Just got enough kamas for ky first sub with orgines and started a 2nd team member that im gonna invest to the class is hupper And wondered which build can be suit i thought about cha or cha with some other element And if any hupper can link me to a guide or give me brief of how use the rune thing system and comboing element it will be awesome Thanks in advance peoples. I dont really like the appearance that has my character. Even with the cool equipment she has, the basic clothes of her class are still visible and i dont really like the result. I understand that they are costumes here too like in dofus, but i dont know if you can actually buy them in the game or are they exclusive to buy them with orgines or as rewards, or something. Mate X isnt hardy given any answers on there Indigo web site. There is a big mist around some photo;s. There are a few video reviews @internet only none of them are testing the bike. Critical questions on there website are being removed. The bikes, i think coast them € 480,00.the cheapest you sell for € 799.and if you sell bikes for over € 10.000.000 the make a lot of provite for a company who doesnt answer questions. The orgine of the Mate X is: https://www.alibaba.com/product-d. 
So i'ts been a while now, and it's been long since the Haki has been intruduced in the series, the fact that everyone can use it, the 3 Types of Haki: Armement, Observation and the one that can only be used by a few people, the King Haki ( i think i'll make a short post on this later ). But the Haki in general and most importantly the amement Haki still relieves a lots of questions in terms of orgines really and we still don't really know aside from it's use when it comes to Devil Fruit Hi I recently started playing Dofus again and I am wondering. what the actual fu happened to it. First of all; It's like 99% p2p now, there is no point in even being a new player. on top of that you can now buy Orgines and exchange them for Kamas.oh and you can buy items with irl money too, forgot about that. Taking this into consideration I thought "Oh I might buy myself some Orgines, and get some new items from the shop. NOPE. can't buy Orgines using paypal. is it because I'm Australi. Ciao a tutti, premetto che non sono di quei complottisti alla Protesi di Complotto che credono al Bilderberg etc, e non ci avevo mai pensato, ma ieri parlando del conflitto arabo-palestinese mi hanno fatto notare una cosa e cioè che quasi tutti i posti nei mass media italiani (e anche all'estero) sono di orgine ebrea. Stamattina sono andato a guardare su un po' di siti ed ho scoperto che - tg2 Marcello Masi - tg5 Clemente Mimum - la7 Enrico Mentana - Corriere della sera/RCS John Elkann - Repub. 
# CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Final 23-Player Rosters CANADA GK – Lars Hirschfeld (Valerenga/Norway); Quillan Roberts (Toronto FC/Canada); Kenny Stamatopoulos (AIK/Sweden) DF – Andre Hainault (VfR Aalen/Germany); Dejan Jakovic (Shimizu S-Pulse/Japan); Nikolas Ledgerwood (Energie Cottbus/Germany); Ashtone Morgan (Toronto FC/Canada); Karl W. Ouimette (New York Red Bulls/USA); Adam Straith (Fredrikstad/Norway) MF – Tesho Akindele (FC Dallas/USA); Kyle Bekker (FC Dallas/USA); Julian. I'm looking into coming back to playing Wakfu. I've played off and on since the closed Beta, and I've been playing Dofus for far too long. I have tons of Kamas on Dofus, which can be spent on Orgines to use on Wakfu. But I have a few questions before I spend my millions of kamas on Orgines to start playing Wakfu again. 1. What is the best class at the moment for solo play? Or could I keep solo playing Osa. 2. Hero system, how does that work? Do the heroes still gain XP or is it the one you're. None of the professions are good. fishes are way too cheaply priced for the amount of work you put into it. breads are way too intensive recipe wise wher eyou need fukking 800 barley to make 100 Fougasse, 400 barley and 100 nettles just to make 100 Carasau. 800 wheat to make 100 sesame seed bread which sells for 3kk per 100. wtf. Alchemy is ridiculous too considering how hard it is to collect these damn herbs, especially sage. 400 sage to make 100 recall potions. takes like fukking. </p>
