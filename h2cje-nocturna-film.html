                            <p> I'm very excited to be attending Nocturna film festival in Madrid this year. Thought I'd share some of the exciting films from the line up that are first on my list of films to see. One. Why Hide? One of my favourite horror movies at the moment. I was fortunate enough to watch it at another festival earlier this year. It has a really cool look and style. Why Hide? nicely blends English comedies ala Notting Hill with the style of comedy found in recent Christmas Horror films like Krampus. I'm going to Nocturna film festival in Madrid this year and I thought I'd share my recommendations of films to see at the festival. My Recommendations are based on movies I've already seen, my research and a movie I'm going to watch again at the festival. A. Why Hide? There has been a recent revival scene of cool Christmas Horror films sparked by Krampus and followed by Better Watch Out. Why Hide? is the fulfillment of this scene and the best example.

Reddit, Over the last two years my two children (daughter now 8; son now 10) have really gotten into movies. As they’ve grown, we expanded our viewing habits but we are running out of good films for them. Help! Below I summarize what they’ve viewed in the hopes that you can suggest some other good titles beyond the obvious algorithms of Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/iTunes (which all seem to suggest the same 25 or so Hollywood films). Moreover, I hope this list can help others who might be looking.

Hi Paul. I'm a great fan of yours and of the DC Animated Universe. I liked very much your work at the DCAU. You, Martin Pasko, Michael Reaves, Alan Burnett and Bruce Timm are the bests DC animation veterans, so I wanted to ask you some questions: 1. During the running of BTAS, many characters, like Black Cannary, Firefly and the Creeper, were considered to appear, but they were rejected, while other characters, like Nocturna and the Sandman were never featured. There are many other characters. Hi Guys! I’m back! I’m looking to destash some of my lovely makeup and perfumes, they are taking up entirely too much space and I'm trying to become more organized!

But I would love to find more films such as this, I know they exist, it's just so hard to find them sometime. Also Princess Mononoke and The Iron Giant are not quite the 'underrated' i'm talking about.
