                            <p> \ TL;DR -- How do I export the properly corrected movie title names from my Plex database on oDroid OpenMediaVault (armhf) so that I don't have to keep retyping them in every time I reinstall Plex? I tried moving Plex files via symbolic link but it fails to start the server up again . is there a guide, or can one of you please help?\ amp#x200B; Hi everyone - As stated above . I have an oDroid XU4, and am using OpenMediaVault's Plex plugin (versus a Docker - I have had extremely I have been running plex on my OMV server using the plugin for about 6 months, have been getting along well. But the plugin doesn't seem to update as often as I would like. Everything has been working well, but the setting page prompts me to manually update. I have decided to get a plex pass and want to try to keep my server as up to date as possible. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience trying to run plex via the docker plugin on omv, and how that experience lines up against running. Dear DataHoarders, I hope you can help me out. Current situation: I have a Zyxel NSA325-V2 NAS running RAID 1 with 2x 4TB WD Disks which are almost full. What I wanna do: I want build my own NAS and replace the Zyxel. I'd like the following features for my new NAS: - SMB shares for my Windows machines and NFS shares for my Kodi device(s) - nzbget/sonarr/radarr for automatic downloading of series/movies - maybe jdownloader for some manual downloading of German stuff (series/movies) I think. So I've been saving up some money and some old computer components for a little while and I'm now finally ready to build my very first home server on top of a 2010ish AMD A8-6600 APU with a fitting mainboard and 16 gigs of RAM. Up until now I used to basically search for magnets on the internet, open them with Tixati and download them to a disorganized "bitorrent" folder on whichever hardrive I was using. A few months ago, when I started building my Plex library, I started creating hardlinks. 
I recently bought a Dell T30, that i want to use as a NAS, Plex server, private cloud and file server. I want it to be linux based for the learning experience. Could you please point me in the right direction of how best to go about achieving the tasks described above? Thanks. Is it possible? At the moment, I have OMV installed on Raspberry pi. I'd like to move it to a laptop with ESATA, because I have 2x 8TB WD Easystore drives connected via USB, and I'd like to shuck them in to a SATA dock. Also move to true gigabit ethernet. TL;DR should I invest the time trying to use freeNAS or will unRAID suffice?? I want to store about 6tb of movies/videos/pictures and run a Plex media server that will stream to 2 Kodi devices in my house. My hardware list: CPU: Intel i3-2130 dual-core 3.4GHz Mobo: Carmel2 (IPISB-CU) has 4 x sata2.0 ports PSU: EVGA 430W RAM: 2 x G.Skill Ripjaws 4gb SSD: Toshiba OCZ 120gb ~~for parity~~ as cache HDD: just ordered 3 x WD Red 3tb OS: Kingston 16gb USB for OS drive. I currently have multiple desktops/laptops/mobile devices that connect to my home network and recently I realized a low powered home server will go a long way to reducing my electricity usage. I got my hands on some spares and built a home server box but my knowledge on the hardware side does not translate to knowing software all that well. ampnbsp; PC Specs: Intel® Pentium® Processor E2140 (1M Cache, 1.60 GHz) 1gb ram 500gb hdd for operating system ampnbsp; I know that adding existing NTFS disks to OMV is possible, but what if I also plan to use the SnapRAID plugin? Do the drives get formatted when setting up the plugin? I have two practically full 2TB WD Green drives and I'll likely be buying a 4TB WD Red as another data drive and a 5TB Toshiba as a parity drive. If the setup WILL format the disks, can I utilize the new parity drive to hold all the data temporarily, add the two old and one new WD to a SnapRAID array Building a NAS/plex server with: PCPartPicker part list (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Tw4xtJ) / Price breakdown by merchant (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Tw4xtJ/by_merchant/) Type Item Price :---- :---- :---- CPU Intel Core i5-750 2.66GHz Quad-Core Processor (https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CHFPxr/intel-cpu-bx80605i5750) Purchased For .00 Motherboard Asus Sabertooth 55I ATX LGA1156 Motherboard (https://pcpartpicker.com/product/j2CwrH/asus-motherboard-sabertooth55i). Hello DataHoarders, I'm new to whole NAS stuff, as I'm just a front-end dev. I was hoping that one of you would be so kind to help me out with a problem I'm having. Right now we have a custom-built system running the OMW NAS software. We would like to back this data up to an external server every so often. Is there a built-in or easy way to achieve this? Or does this require something a bit more sophisticated? Thanks in advance. I'm planning to build a NAS for my home server, mostly for media and photos (I'm a photographer). What's are the pros and cons to both FreeNAS and unRAID? The big pro to unRAID that I can see is the ability to add drives to an existing setup. That way I could start out with a few 3TB drives now and add more later as needed, even mixing sizes as drives get bigger and prices come down. I built a file server years ago when 200Gig was a really big drive :-) FreeNAS I was told to x/post here I have checked out Freenas but it seems finicky (Network adapters, which hardware places nice, etc) I've seen some econ builds of freenas which are around 500+ still. So I am looking for other options, other possibilities. Should I go for pre-built solutions? I need a unit that allows for storage of music and video files. Steaming via some features of freenas would be nice, such as plex or owncloud. 
HI all, amp#x200B; amp#x200B; I set up a openvpn service on my openmediavault server, I can login to my samba folders remotely on my phone/laptop and also browse the internet using my own internet line but i also want to hide my ISP's IP. amp#x200B; I see people who have the same problem add this push "redirect-gateway def1" to openvpn conf file, i have this in mine. "push "redirect-gateway local def1 bypass-dhcp" what else can I do to hide my ip? amp#x200B; \-------------------. I’m planning on running a openmediavault server with the Plex plugin, if I install a p2000 card will Plex be able to detect it and use it for hardware transcoding. Has anyone tried this?? Any advice would be helpful. Hello, amp#x200B; I'm not a professional on computer hardware but i will try to setup my personal NAS and media server (the price for commercial NAS/Media server is so high for the performance reached) amp#x200B; I will install OpenMediaVault with Plex (or other media server), nextcloud and others plugins. amp#x200B; The medial will be watched essentially by me and maybe two other persons max. amp#x200B; Nextcloud will manage my documents. amp#x200B; I have setup this configu. I'm trying to figure out how to use snapraid to pool my disks in a JBOD format. No parity, no duplication. Just 2 or more disks acting as one. I chose SR because it said it can have disks of different sizes and that it can add drives with data currently on them. But pretty much every tutorial out there, including openmediavault's how to on the snapraid plugin, only give instructions how to create redundancy arrays. Can anyone point me in the right direction. Hi all - Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something here but I am unable to remove a Docker image from my OpenMediaVault install. I keep getting this error message - Error #0: OMV\ExecException: Failed to execute command 'export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin; export LANG=C.UTF-8; docker rmi ae875d31612b' with exit code '1': in /usr/share/php/openmediavault/system/process.inc:182 Stack trace: #0 /usr/share/openmediavault/engined/rpc/docker.inc(292): OMV\Syste. I'm looking to install rtorrent on my server and have found this useful looking guide (https://forum.openmediavault.org/index.php/Thread/19553-OMV-Docker-plugin-media-server-Plex-PlexPy-Ombi-Libresonic-NZBGet-ruTorrent-Sona/?postID=152905#post152905) which explains how to install rutorrent. Am I being thick or is this for rutorrent only? Or does the docker mentioned in the guide (https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/rutorrent/) contain rtorrent AND rutorrent? Feeling invincible after getting. Spent my Christmas holidays tinkering with my new Plex Media Server and decided it would be fun to create a landing webpage for my family to see what is new on the server, and have remote access to Sonarr/Radarr so they can add their own content too (password protected in addition to access to the website). I host the website locally on my NAS loaded with openmediavault. I thought that I could create a simple Wordpress plugin to show the most recently added Movies and TV shows. Clicking. 
I'm new to the server side of computing and find it very interesting so I would like to learn more by experimenting. The only problem is that I don't know what OS to go for. I already have a prebuild NAS, Western digital my cloud EX2 ultra, at home for data so the server would run the applications that I can't run on the NAS. I have to two choices of hardware; 1. An old toshiba satellite laptop (i5 M480, 4GB DDR3 RAM) 2. salvaged dekstop (intel pentium E6300, 3GB DDR2 RAM) What would Hello I'm getting error pretty much from the start and I'm on my 10th or so reinstall of the software to my SD Card (SanDisk Ultra 32gb microSDHC USH-I card) I've downloaded the OMV\_4\_Odroid\_XU4\_HC1\_HC2.img.xz image from the openmediavault website and used etcher to burn it onto my SD Card.
