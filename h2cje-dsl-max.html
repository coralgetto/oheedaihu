                            <p> I just got all my gear to setup my new network, but am having issues doing transparent bridging from my CenturyLink c2000A and handing off the PPoE to the edge router. Previously i had bridged an older modem to a netgear router without issue, but the C2000A seems to be having issues. I have checked that my PPoE creds are correct, and all the VDSL settings are correct. But the router and modem dont seem to communicate much or establish a PPoE connection. I have tried multiple. Hi All, My home gets 3Mbps DSL max, with no cable service. To run a cable service line, the cost was quoted at K. On top of that, it would be a business line, so extra $$$. My back neighbour, who is 400 ft from my house, gets cable internet (1 Gbps speeds). Now, I already checked with the cable company, and they do allow multiple cable accounts to the same address. So we aren't breaking ToS if we have our own separate accounts. So, my question is, what is the best approach 
Coverage is good with T\-Mobile but there are a lot of dead areas once you get south of Pekin and heading west towards Galesburg. The area is band 71 blocked until quite a few channels relocate and USCC owns the Band 12 in the area. My parents live in one of those "dead areas" \(just northeast of Mackinaw, IL \- Zip 61755\) and T\-Mobile's official solution is "get a CellSpot". Well, they have 3mb DSL \(max\) where they are and there is NO T\-Mobile signal at all unless I'm willing to climb. The situation is the following: I life in an apartment building in Austria with 36 flats. Internet is pretty bad (DSL max. 16 Mbit/s) and during evening times dropping to as low as 2 Mbit/s. So I investigated on options around our building. Communicating with the cable network operator they told me there is cable TV with coaxial cable and optical fiber in the street in front of the building. The distribution cabinet for the coaxial cable is literally 10m from the building. They told me digging. Drop outs are being blamed on my end due to "more uploading than downloading" is this even a thing? Especially on an ADSL line where speedtests tell me my down is 12mb and my upload is 0.6mb or are they just talking out their asses because they can't give me a reason? Edit: After speaking with the ISP again it was resolved, there was something going on that was causing the DSL to cap out due to uploading, they did something on their end but wouldnt explain (or couldn't). Either way thank First the back story: I live in an area of North Central Florida caught in the digital divide. The only reasonable option I have for data services is AT&T DSL (max supported 3mb 2.5D /500kU ). There are Satellite and Cellular services that are per bit usage, which is not ideal for your Netflix/Hulu/Amazon watching and Online Gaming user. There is a large name cable provider in the area a street or two over that repeatedly solicits me via email and post mail to sell services however, after. So I have a huge discrepancy in what speeds Consolidated is telling me I'm getting with OOKLA vs what I am actually getting. I can't stream Netflix with out it buffering very often nor can two people use the internet at once, usually. These are the screenshots of my data ( Its pretty frustrating to pay for 6 Mbps a month and only be getting a max of 700Kbps on average. We are still bringing in our internet through ADSL but DSL's max ban with is 8Mbps 150k DSL here, so the max download speed should be somwhere at 18,75 MB/s (can someone confirm?). Obviously I can't reach that, since I'm using Wlan. However, every speedtest result shows that I apparently only have 30-40k DSL max, when downloading via Steam etc. I easily reach 8-10 MB/s though. How can those websites be so horribly inaccurate? Edit: Just made another test, 18MBp/s (so 18k) which would equal ~1.7MB/s  like what? Edit2:. DSL max speed is limited by how far away you are from the service provider. For example: I sign up for a 15mb plan but only get maybe 10mb max. Anything like this with cable? If I sign up for 25mb will I be guaranteed. Hello! I am over at parents' for Christmas, and have been trying to solve their network issues to no avail. The problem is the connection always slows down after about 24 hours, and they have to restart the router to get the speed back up again. And the same thing happens again in 24 hours. It seems like the bandwidth doesn't really go down (30mbps down, 1mbps up actual), but ping goes up from about 20ms to 1000ms. I thought it's something wrong with the router, so I replaced it (now using. 
I run DAZN through a DSL cable on a fiber optic internet connection that averages 200 up and down. the ads are perfectly clear, but on half the plays before the ball is snapped the picture gets super pixelated. It's been enough time. DAZN MUST figure out how to provide a quality stream. I'm sick of this. Figure I recently upgraded my friend's office from a coax cable connection to Comcast Dedicated Ethernet fiber. Comcast made a big deal about how I needed to make sure I shaped the outbound traffic so as not to exceed the CIR (200/200), otherwise TCP traffic would be severely affected. This wasn't a problem as we had a Palo Alto firewall that could easily do that, but it made me wonder why this was something I had to do instead of the coax connections where we just plugged E0 on the firewall Edit: OK, I'll try to rephrase, because the DSL apparently has complex techniques for multiplexing & reducing echo & transmission errors. Let's assume the simplest case, an analogue signal carrying a digital signal in a wire. What's the minimum frequency of the analogue signal that can carry a bandwidth of x Kbps? ---- Original question: So the telco is saying that my copper wire can provide up to about 35Mbps of DSL connection speed. Does this mean that the carrier signal. Has anyone revised the spreadsheet of the card upgrade costs through max level after 3.0? Thanks. I have a Bell Homehub 2000 that's providing me with 25Mbps, Fibe TV and a landline. My package has changed recently to reduce the monthly bill cost, while upgrading to 50Mbps. The moment Bell did the upgrade, our internet went down because their crappy gear can't support the 50. When I finally spent an hour with them on the phone to get it reverted so the internet would work again, they send a technician to physically do an upgrade. The technician was in my house for 30 seconds Next month I am moving to Shadow Oaks apartments in the 78759 area. I called the property about which ISPs would be available and apparently they only offer AT&T and Spectrum. I am looking for the fastest speed possible and price is irrelevant, so I called AT&T to ask about their fiber optic service. They told me fiber connectivity was available at 25mbps. I asked if that was the fastest speed available and the woman on the phone told me it was. My question is how is that possible?. Is it worth it? Anyone with any experience with it? We're getting it installed this month at Traver ridge, and curious if it's genuine fiber or like some bs marketing? Worth the price over Comcast? Thanks. 
I've had Cox upper tier internet for years. too many. Although the service has been great overall, We're redoing TV and 'Net options. Is anyone using this speed for gaming? How is it? I'm used to very good response, draws, etc. so somewhat concerned about the lower speeds. Currently I have the 100Mbps option and have no issues. I've also gone over the 1TB download limit twice for work, and have not seen or heard any consequence billing, notice or otherwise. Thanks. I'm currently a TSI cable customer in AB and use Hurricane Electric as my IPv6 tunnel broker. It works great, except for netflix which blocks HE because "proxies". I would love to have v6 provided by TSI, especially if I can get a routed prefix in addition to a /64 (so I can do prefix delegation for my home lab). Even if it's not a supported commercial service ready for customers I'd be a willing participant in an unreliable, unsupported, experimental deployment. As the title says, I'm considering using the Unifi AP Lite for home use to replace the WiFi in the ISP's modem. I'm primarily a DD-WRT user and have QoS setup on my main router and am pretty happy with how it works. In doing the research for the Ubiquiti hardware, I'm not seeing much for a QoS setup. I'm going to have a guest network with restricted speed but I'd like certain devices to have priority (phones for WiFi calling) over others (Chromecast, TV). Is this possible with a Unifi. 
I haven't changed any options. I did upgrade to the latest version earlier this week. I've also tried on multiple networks and through my phone's hotspot. I'm unclear: Do the Puma 6 chipset's latency issues only affect Cable modems. I always see it being discussed in the context of Cable. So I have been playing csgo for 4 years now and recently ranked up to global. I decided to upgrade my internet to start playing more seriously. I got 90 ping on the old internet. When I got the new one which is double the speed of my old one I still get 90 ping and sometimes 120. Even tho on other games like dota, pubg, and h1 I get amazing ping. Is there a fix for this or some way I can make my connection better.
